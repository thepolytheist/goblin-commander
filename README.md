```
A command line monster army control game written in Python.

## Motivation
I mostly wrote Goblin Commander because I wanted a project for practicing Python, but anything too purely technical felt
like it was too close to work. I had also had this idea a while back of playing the commander of a monstrous army that
was constantly having to fight the forces of good. This silly game came from that initial inspiration.

## How to Play
If you don't already have the virtual environment set up, then **from the root folder**, run
```commandline
python3 -m venv venv
```
then
```commandline
source ./venv/bin/activate
```
to activate the virtual environment. You can then install the Python requirements with
```commandline
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
After that, simply start the game with
```commandline
python3 goblincommander/main.py
```
